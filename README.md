## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

1. ### Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS version recommended)

- npm or yarn

2. ### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dere-12/portfolio.git
cd portfolio
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. ### Configure Formspree:
   Before running, you must update your Formspree hash in src/components/Contact/ContactForm.jsx.
   Open src/components/Contact/ContactForm.jsx and replace "mqayrjwp" with your unique Formspree hash:

```bash
// src/components/Contact/ContactForm.jsx
const [state, handleSubmit] = useForm("YOUR_UNIQUE_FORMSPREE_HASH");
```

## Running Locally

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

This will start the Vite development server, and you can view your application in the browser at `http://localhost:5173/` (or a similar address)..
